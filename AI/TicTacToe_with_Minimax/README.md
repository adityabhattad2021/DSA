# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm

This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game using the Minimax algorithm for the computer player. The Minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used for decision making in game theory and artificial intelligence.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the game by executing the Python script:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

### Usage

The game starts with an empty board. The player is prompted to make a move by entering a number corresponding to the position on the board (0-8). The computer then makes its move using the Minimax algorithm. The game continues until there is a winner or the board is full.

## Testing

Unit tests are included to verify the functionality of the Minimax algorithm and other components of the game. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```
