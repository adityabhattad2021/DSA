Aim: Implement activity selection algorithm for the given scenario.
Problem Definition: In the single-machine scheduling problem, we are given a set of n activities Ai. Each job i
has a starting time si, deadline di and profit pi. At any time instant, we can do only one job. Doing a job i earns a profit pi. Generate a solution to select the largest set of mutually compatible jobs and calculate the total profit generated by the machine. The greedy algorithm for single-machine scheduling selects the job using activity selection algorithm.
