## My Obeservation from this practical is that, When we use brute force apprach to find min and max on a small data set, it takes more time than divide and conquer approach, but as the size of data increases the time taken by divide and conquer approach to calculate min and max increases exponentially where as with brute force the time increases linearly, because of which for large data, time taken by divide and conquer is much much more than brute force.
