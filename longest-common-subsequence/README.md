# Aim: Implement Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to find the length and LCS for DNA sequences.

## Problem Statement:
DNA sequences can be viewed as strings of A, C, G, and T characters, which represent
nucleotides. Finding the similarities between two DNA sequences are an important
computation performed in bioinformatics.
[Note that a subsequence might not include consecutive elements of the original sequence.]

TASK-1: Find the similarity between the given X and Y sequence.
X=AGCCCTAAGGGCTACCTAGCTT
Y= GACAGCCTACAAGCGTTAGCTTG
Output: Cost matrix with all costs, final cost of LCS.

TASK-2: A subsequence of a given sequence is palindrome if it reads the same when read
from left to right or right to left. Design an algorithm that take a sequence X[1...n].
Find all the possible palindrome sub-sequences for the given DNA sequence
