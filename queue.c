    What is queue?
    => Queue is Linear data sturucture which operates in FIFO(FIrst in First Out) or  LILO(Last in Last Out).
    - It is named queue as it behaves like a real-world queue, for example - queue(line) of cars in a simgle lane, queue of people waiting at a food counter.
    - Queue is an abstract data type with a bounded(predefined) capacity.
    - It is a simple data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a perticular order.

/*

/*
    Some application of queue data sturctures.
    - Queue is used when things but have to be processed in First in First Out order.
    - CPU sheduling, Disk sheduling.
    - Handling of interrupts in realtime systems. the interupts are handled in the same order as they arrive, first come first served.
    - In real life, Call Centers phone systems will use queues, to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free.
    - When data is transferred asynchronously between two processes. Queue is used for synchronization.
