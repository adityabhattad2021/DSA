## Aim: Perform Fractional Knapsack for the given scenario.
Problem Definition: Suppose you are a transport dealer and want to load a truck
with different types of boxes. Assume there are 50 types of boxes (Box-1 to Box-50),
which weigh different and that the truck has a maximum capacity (truckSize). Each
box has a profit value associated with it. It is the commission that the transporter will
receive after transporting the box. You can choose any box to put on the truck as
long as the number of boxes does not exceed truckSize.
### Tasks:
A. Load the truck using different methods:
1. Minimum weight
2. Maximum profit
3. Profit/weight ratio.
### Compute the total profit using each method and infer the best performing method.
B. Compute the time required in each method and plot the graph.
Given Data:
 Capacity of truck 850 Kgs
 Weight in kg for each box:
[7, 0, 30, 22, 80, 94, 11, 81, 70, 64, 59, 18, 0, 36, 3, 8, 15, 42, 9, 0, 42, 47, 52, 32,
26, 48, 55, 6, 29, 84, 2, 4, 18, 56, 7, 29, 93, 44, 71, 3, 86, 66, 31, 65, 0, 79, 20, 65,
52, 13]
 Profit in Rs for each box:
[ 360, 83, 59, 130, 431, 67, 230, 52, 93, 125, 670, 892, 600, 38, 48, 147, 78, 256,
63, 17, 120, 164, 432, 35, 92, 110, 22, 42, 50, 323, 514, 28, 87, 73, 78, 15, 26, 78,
210, 36, 85, 189, 274, 43, 33, 10, 19, 389, 276,  312 ]
